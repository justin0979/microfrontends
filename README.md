## Basic Microfrontend App for Practice

Use of microfrontends with a container to coordinate signup/signout autentication, and showing a marketing/dashboard.

React and Vue frameworks will be used.

My progress is on-going (currently at Section 13) and Pricing, Landing, and Header component code has been provided by Stephen Grider. The rest of the code is 99.9% from the lectures (the 0.1% comes from minor changes like having to move StylesProvider component to different spot to get the prefixes to work in development).
